"""
Used for API Backend management of the Crypta service.
This module contains the Django application configuration for the Crypta service.
It sets up the necessary configurations for the Django application, including
database settings, authentication backends, and middleware.
It also includes the URL routing for the API and the admin interface.
It is important to note that this module is not intended to be run directly.
Instead, it should be imported and used by the Django application.
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and
isolate the application from the system Python installation.
It is also recommended to use a configuration management tool to manage
the settings for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
